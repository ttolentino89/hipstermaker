This web app uses the Binary Jazz Genrerator + UINames APIs to create an entirely new fake millenial with music taste that's better than yours. The documentation for both APIs can be found below-

Genrerator:

UINames:
https://uinames.com/

This project is a work in progress and is most likely subject to change by the end of the week. Other ideas I'm playing with are a random quote generator using the same profile pictures generated by the UINames API which will probably be way less pretentious sounding or offensive.

How it works:

1. The user clicks through the "Make a New Hispter" button on the homepage after reading a brief instructional prompt.
2. User chooses parameters that are passed through the API such as gender, country, and possibly age (although most millenials are in the 20-30ish range so this may not be necessary.
3. If the user clicks "yes" on "Music Snob", a call will be made to the Genrerator API to create a new genre and story that will appear on the next screen along with the other info.
4. User clicks "generate" button, user input is fed to the API and creates an entirely new fake millenial using data fed from UINames API.
5. User is then given the option to "create a new millenial", this continuing the endless cycle of creating new fake hipsters for some bizarre impractical reason, possibly catfishing.
6. ....profit?

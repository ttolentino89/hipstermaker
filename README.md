This web app uses the Binary Jazz Genrerator + UINames APIs to create an entirely new fake millenial with music taste that's better than yours. The documentation for both APIs can be found below-

Genrerator:

UINames:

This project is a work in progress and is most likely subject to change by the end of the week.
